i start a new test file -> test2.py

im still working on the workflow i believe in (have sent my understanding about the workflow in slack), so far im trying to find a good way 

to store into database, i think i have found a way but i need to test more

you are all welcome to make any changes, i probably wont join u until estern time 12pm at least
